"""Listing → list[Requirement]. One public function: extract_requirements(listing).

The model proposes requirements, each with a verbatim source_span. Python keeps only the ones whose
span is actually in the description. Anything else is dropped and reported — that drop is the

Rules:
- One Requirement per distinct qualification. Split combined bullets ("Python and Go") only if the
  posting treats them as separate items.
- source_span: copy a contiguous substring of the posting EXACTLY as written, character for
  character. Never paraphrase, trim words from the middle, or fix typos. The span is how your work
  gets verified; a span that is not in the posting will be discarded.
- text: the requirement in plain words. May shorten the span; may not add to it.
- preferred: true only if the item sits under a heading like "Preferred", "Nice to have", "Bonus".
- gate: true only for hard eligibility: security clearance, work authorization or sponsorship,
  a required degree, a required location, or a stated minimum years of experience.
- Only extract from requirement/qualification sections. Skip responsibilities, company blurbs,
  and benefits.
- If the posting has no requirements, return an empty list. Never invent."""
